### Problem:
Since Colorado does not ask for race/ethnicity when we register to vote, campaign managers/activists have no idea of the ethnicity/race of Colorado voters or they have to pay premium to access external data without a way to examine the provided predictive models directly.

### Clients: Campaigners/Activists
#### User Case 1: Colorado Democratic Party
[Check video sent by our client](https://github.com/GoCodeColorado/RegisVoterDatalytics/blob/master/ClientRequest%20from%20CoDem.mov)

#### Current problem:
1. Inability to identify voterâ€™s race and ethnicity.
2. Unable to determine if race/ethnicity was a primary factor when voting. 
3. Do not know if targeted racial ad campaigns are effective. 

#### Our approach:
1. Create map with voter history data and geo information.
2. Assign racial possibility individually according to census data
3. Aggregate and analyze each category and compare the changes every year.
4. Visualize our results and ask for feedback

#### Main questions answered:
1. Race and ethnic breakdown and % change of voters since 2014
2. Comparision between different groups and locations

#### Main finding:

1. Native voters who voted as UAF (no party affiliation) is growing significantly.
2. Voter percentage by race hasn't change much in the last 5 year although the total voter counts has increased by about 10,000 each year.
3. [Table showing voter who switched party](https://github.com/GoCodeColorado/RegisVoterDatalytics/blob/master/AnalyticsResults/Plots/Switching_Political_Parties.png)
<br>
There is a significant difference <<<0.05 in the number of voters in the Dem, Rep, and UAF political parties in almost all racial groups in our findings.

### Next stage:
1. Expand to the whole state
2. Collect data on targeted ad campaigns from client to analyze their efficiency and possible ways for improvement
