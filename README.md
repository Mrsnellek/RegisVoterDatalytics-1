### Problem:
Since Colorado does not ask for race/ethnicity when we register to vote, campaign managers have no idea of the ethnicity/race of Colorado voters or they have to pay premium to access external data without a way to examine the provided predictive models directly.

### Clients: Campaigners/Activists
### Main question answered:
1. Race and ethnic breakdown of voters since 2016 and the % change in each group since 2014
2. Detailed slices with gender, age, and census block groups
3. Prediction for 2020
